                        <h2>“Ride like everybody is out to kill you”</h2>
                        <p>— is a phrase every rider has heard
                            sooner or later in their motorcycling journey. In the state of Victoria in Australia,
                            motorcycles make up 4% of all registered vehicles, yet account for 17% of deaths and serious
                            injuries. Similar figures can also be seen in the UK and a vast majority of cases are due
                            to the negligence of other road users. The dangers associated with motorcycles are
                            well-documented, widely acknowledged
                            and backed up by statistics. With all that said, how did I possibly end up here?</p>

                        <p>To the surprise of friends and close associates, I bought a motorcycle early last year,
                            incentivised by my declining mental health at the time. Many motorcyclists find
                            that riding significantly contributes to stress reduction and improves their mental
                            well-being. The demands of motorcycling necessitate constant alertness and the rider’s
                            complete mental focus. It is, in its own unique way, a form of mindfulness meditation. After
                            nearly a year of motorcycling, do I agree with these claims? To a great extent, I do.
                            There’s also neuroscience research to back up these claims conducted by researchers at UCLA.
                            They found that riding a motorcycle for 20 minutes resulted in decreased cortisol levels,
                            greater tolerance to distractions, and enhanced sensory focus in participants.</p>
                        <p>On my motorcycling journey, I discovered that there are many other benefits to riding other
                            than its therapeutic effects. A vast majority of these benefits are often understated
                            and overshadowed by the prevailing negative connotations associated with motorcycling.</p>

                        <h2>It’s not all doom and gloom</h2>
                        <p>Riding a motorcycle creates a deep sense of unity between you and your surroundings. You feel
                            the
                            wind’s exhilarating rush, a sense of freedom. You feel the temperatures shift ever so
                            slightly as you move from shade to sun. You’re fully enveloped in the sights, sounds and
                            smells of your surroundings. All these elements come together to create the perfect
                            adventure for
                            travellers wanting to immerse themselves in their environment. If travelling solo isn’t your
                            thing, you can always bring along a passenger to share the experience with. A motorcycle is
                            an
                            excellent choice for travel enthusiasts and adventure seekers.</p>

                        <p>A motorcycle can make commuting to work fun. When rush hour hits, roads transform into
                            car parks and the crawl begins. On a motorcycle you won’t have to
                            spend too long in
                            asphalt purgatory. Here in Australia, motorcyclists can filter through stopped and slow
                            moving traffic and it's completely legal if done safely. It’s also legal in the UK and most
                            states of the USA. However, you may not exceed 30 km/h while doing so, as that is considered
                            “lane-splitting” and is unlawful. Coming up with the most efficient strategy to get through
                            traffic is a fun little exercise to play on your commute, as long as you do it safely and
                            responsibly.</p>
                        <p>On a motorcycle, other road users will be more open to striking a conversation with you while
                            stopped at the lights or in traffic. Me being an introvert, I usually do not initiate these
                            conversations but there have been numerous instances where someone would put down their car
                            window to compliment my bike, or a kid at the backseat would start waving. You will also get
                            lots of nods from other motorcyclists and it’s always a great moment when that happens.</p>
                        <p>Riding a motorcycle also gives you unbeatable fuel efficiency and your commute contributes
                            less emissions to the environment compared to the average car driver. A motorcycle may be a
                            poor choice for hauling goods and people but for a white-collar office worker like myself,
                            it makes for an excellent commuting machine.</p>
                        <p>Oh, and as an added bonus, riding a motorcycle burns a lot more calories than you might
                            think. According to Dr. Michael, a radiologist who rides motorcycles, you can expect to burn
                            up to 300 calories per every hour of riding. Although the actual number varies quite a bit
                            based on the intensity of riding. For example, off-roaders and enduro riders will burn more
                            calories than the average city commuter. Nevertheless, it’s a nice added perk for those
                            wanting to stay fit.</p>

                        <h2>Paying it forward</h2>
                        <p>Being entirely self-taught, my motorcycling knowledge is largely derived from my own personal
                            experience but also from the insights shared by fellow riders. Now
                            I’m paying it forward by sharing my own experiences and some pro tips. I hope this may be
                            beneficial to
                            someone who’s new to riding or is interested in getting into it.</p>

                        <h3>Like taming a horse</h3>
                        <p>Learn and understand how your motorcycle behaves. Emphasis on “your” as
                            every motorcycle is tuned differently and handles differently. The throttle response, the
                            turning radius, the suspension rebound, and the biting point of the clutch are all
                            different from model to model. Which is why it’s extremely important that you learn and
                            understand the characteristics of your own motorcycle. The phrase “become one with the bike”
                            gets thrown around a lot in motorcycling circles and for good reason. Even an experienced
                            motorcyclist with many years of riding experience can be considered a beginner on a bike
                            that
                            they have never ridden before. Take your motorcycle to a quiet place like an empty car park
                            where you can safely experiment with its controls and learn how it responds.</p>

                        <h3>“Pick a bike that doesn’t freak you out” - Keanu Reeves</h3>
                        <p>Obviously, before you do any of that, you need to pick a bike. You should
                            take Keanu’s advice here (he’s always right, anyway).</p>
                        <p>Stick to a sub-400cc motorcycle if you’ve never ridden before. Anything higher than this will
                            most likely overwhelm you. Here in Australia, there is also a CC limit imposed on
                            motorcycles that are considered “learner approved” and as of writing, the most powerful
                            learner approved motorcycle is the Yamaha MT-07 LAMS edition with an engine capacity of
                            655cc.</p>
                        <p>Aside from power, you should choose a bike with a seating position that you feel comfortable
                            with. Sport bikes like the Kawasaki Ninja 400 typically require the rider to assume a
                            forward-leaning position while naked bikes like the KTM 390 Duke or Kawasaki Z400 offer a
                            more upright seating position. For everyday riding, I consider the upright seating
                            position of a naked bike far more comfortable than the forward-leaning position of a sport
                            bike. But your experience may differ. Have a play around with several different motorcycles
                            at local dealerships and see which feels the most comfortable.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Don’t skimp out on gear</h3>
                        <p>Get yourself a decent helmet from a reputable brand. I strongly advise a full face helmet
                            with a Pinlock anti-fog insert. Beginner riders often neglect to buy protective equipment
                            when they start out. Acknowledge that as a beginner, you are at your most vulnerable. So
                            don’t skimp out on gear. Get yourself an abrasion resistant riding jacket, pants and boots.
                            If the typical “rider look” isn’t your style, there are plenty of riding gear that
                            masquerade as casual everyday clothes. But on the inside, they come with a lot of neat
                            safety features like weather proofing, kevlar lining, knee guards and elbow guards. With
                            options like these, you can express yourself while riding safely. Remember that the colour
                            of the gear you wear matters. White or brightly coloured gear helps you stand out and be
                            easily seen by other road users.</p>

                        <h3>True skill is in riding slow, not fast</h3>
                        <p>As it turns out, riding a motorcycle on a straight road at 100 km/h requires almost no
                            effort. Anybody could do that. On a motorcycle equipped with cruise control, this could be
                            done with your hands completely off the handlebars. Taking corners at 100 km/h is a
                            different story though. As a motorcyclist, your mastery of slow speed manoeuvres is a strong
                            indicator of your overall ability. Slow speed manoeuvres involve riding your motorcycle at
                            walking speed (under 5 km/h) with both feet up and making tight U-turns, among other things.
                            Pulling these off requires proper balance, good peripheral vision, and solid clutch control.
                            Here in Australia, all riders must complete an advanced motorcycle training course and the
                            accompanying practical test before they are allowed their full motorcycle license. And most
                            advanced motorcycle courses spend an exorbitant amount of time teaching these concepts and
                            making you practice them out on the range.</p>
                        <p>As a rider, I advise that you take matters into your own hands and spend some time practicing
                            these manoeuvres at your local car park. It could be just a quick 20 minute session after
                            you get back from work or uni. It will make you a safer rider as well as help you get
                            through the advanced motorcycle test with ease.</p>
                        <p>Your choice of motorcycle matters when it comes to slow speed manoeuvres. If you choose to
                            get a sport bike such as the Kawasaki Ninja 400, you will be at a disadvantage as the form
                            factor and seating position make pulling off slow manoeuvres more difficult.
                            Once again, I recommend picking a naked bike because they are much better suited for slow
                            speed manoeuvres than sport bikes or cruisers. That’s in addition to their comfortable
                            upright seating position which also makes them more suitable for everyday riding. The
                            Kawasaki Z400, the Yamaha MT–03 and KTM’s 390 Duke are excellent beginner naked bikes. When
                            taking the advanced motorcycle test in Australia, you can choose to bring your
                            own motorcycle to do the test with. All three motorcycles I’ve listed previously are
                            great choices for the test. Obviously, your ability as a rider matters greatly here, it’s
                            not just about the type of motorcycle you ride.</p>

                        <h3>Zero BAC, at all times</h3>
                        <p>Aim for zero blood alcohol content if you need to ride your motorcycle. Riding a motorcycle
                            requires far
                            more finesse and skill than driving a car. Your sense of balance is critical while riding.
                            Even a little bit of alcohol in your system can impair your senses and put you off balance.
                            Don’t drink and ride, it’s not worth it.</p>

                        <h3>Lane filter responsibly</h3>
                        <p>Lane filtering with a motorcycle is both scary and rewarding at the same time. Only lane
                            filter if you feel like it’s safe to do so and stay within a reasonable speed. In Australia,
                            filtering at over 30 km/h is illegal and will get you pulled over. As a rule of thumb, I
                            also avoid filtering next to large vehicles such as lorries and buses. If you are filtering
                            up to the lights, I advise staying behind the first row of vehicles instead of filtering
                            straight up to the front. The first row of vehicles will start moving as soon as the lights
                            go green and if you happen to be in the middle of this row when that happens, it will put
                            you in a dangerous situation. Note that drivers stuck in traffic are often distracted, so
                            always pay close attention to other vehicles while filtering. Turning on your motorcycle’s
                            hazard lights is a good way to draw attention to yourself and also signal to other road
                            users that you are filtering. Make sure to turn them off afterwards. You will only get good
                            at lane filtering the more you do it, but please do it responsibly and safely.</p>

                        <h3>Minimise risks, maximise rewards</h3>
                        <p>I’ll wrap things up by stating that while motorcycling has its risks, those risks can be
                            mitigated by proper training, wearing safety gear, maintaining good awareness, and by
                            following the rules. I would argue that a cyclist riding a push bicycle would be at a
                            greater risk than a skilled motorcyclist who sticks to the above principles. Most push
                            cyclists do not wear any protective gear, are completely exposed and do not have the
                            capability to quickly get out of sticky situations, should one arise.
                            Both cyclists and motorcyclists should take extra care at all times.</p>

                        <p>Motorcycles can be a great stress reliever, a highly efficient commuting machine and also
                            perfect for travel enthusiasts wanting to immerse themselves in their surroundings. You just
                            don’t get the same experience inside an air conditioned metal cage. I cannot understate the
                            risks however. But I also think the benefits can outweigh the risks, if those risks are
                            properly managed.</p>

                        <p>Thanks for making it to the end and I hope it was enlightening. I wish you all the best in
