      <description>Picking apart the interactive music system in the 2013 Killer Instinct reboot</description>
      <content:encoded>
            <![CDATA[<h2>Preface</h2>
                        <p>In this technical piece, I break down the interactive music system in the 2013 Killer
                            Instinct Reboot for Xbox One. It’s somewhat of an old article as the research I’ve done here
                            came
                            out of a student game I worked on at university. The details are still very much relevant
                            and I’ve refreshed minor tid-bits while keeping the bulk of it intact.</p>

                        <figure>

                        </figure>

                        <p>Right off the bat, I’ll state that Killer Instinct has the best soundtrack ever
                            composed for a fighting game, and that’s saying a lot given the existence of both Guilty
                            Gear and Street Fighter. I’ll also go on to state that it’s one of the greatest OSTs of the
                            eighth gen console lineup and one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever composed. The
                            gushing doesn’t stop there. It also has one of the best implemented
                            interactive music systems in any video game.</p>

                        <p>An interactive music system alters the music in response to player actions and changing
                            conditions in the game. Some notable examples include SSX (2012) which applies a parametric
                            EQ filter to the soundtrack when performing tricks, or Transistor (2014) which vertically
                            remixes the instrumental version of the soundtrack with a vocal-only version depending on
                            the game
                            state.</p>

                        <h2>Music states</h2>
                        <p>Killer Instinct’s music system consists of several different states and each state
                            corresponds to a particular condition in the game itself. The music states are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fighter A Intro</li>
                            <li>Fighter B Intro</li>
                            <li>Intro</li>
                            <li>Normal</li>
                            <li>Combo</li>
                            <li>Breaker</li>
                            <li>Boring</li>
                            <li>Danger</li>
                            <li>Ending</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The music system uses horizontal
                            resequencing to transition between the states based on the
                            current condition of the match. Killer Instinct utilises Audiokinetic Wwise to implement
                            this.</p>

                        <h3>Breakdown</h3>

                        <p>Now I’ll attempt to break down each of these states and explain which game conditions are
                            required as a prerequisite to activate them. I made extensive use of Killer Instinct’s fight
                            replay feature which allows stopping time and frame stepping. This has so many use cases and
                            one of them is examining how the music system works.</p>

                        <h4>Fighter A Intro</h4>
                        <p>Killer Instinct is a one-versus-one fighting game. At the start of every match, a short
                            cutscene ensues introducing each fighter. The music system includes two consecutive
                            states to underscore each fighter’s introductory segment. The system initially starts
                            things off in this state. After the first fighter’s introduction is delivered, the music
                            transitions into the next state.</p>

                        <h4>Fighter B Intro</h4>
                        <p>When the second fighter’s introductory cutscene plays, the music system follows up with the
                            introduction of additional layers in the mix.</p>

                        <h4>Intro</h4>
                        <p>After both fighters are introduced, control is handed over to the players and the match
                            formally begins. A short musical intro will ensue and the music transitions into the Normal
                            state.</p>

                        <h4>Normal</h4>
                        <p>As with most other pieces of music, the songs in Killer Instinct consist of
                            distinct sections such as verse, chorus, breakdown and ending. In the Normal state, the
                            music system only cues music segments from the verse of the current song. The game, on
                            average, spends most of its time in this state during a match. To keep things interesting,
                            Killer Instinct divides each verse into 4 bar segments and the sequence of the segments are
                            randomised, generating a different permutation of the verse on each instance of playback.
                            Wwise’s random containers are used to implement this.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="https://heraldofgargos.github.io/journal/assets/killer_instinct_1.jpg">
                            <figcaption>A 16 hit combo against Cinder</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h4>Combo</h4>

                        <p>The system transitions to the Combo state if either fighter achieves a 16 hit combo or higher
                            during the match. In the combo state, the system only cues segments from the chorus of the
                            song, which are also divided into 4 bar segments. No randomisation between the segments is
                            performed in the Combo state. If either player is unable to attain a follow-up 16 hit combo
                            during this period, the system transitions back to the Normal state, but allows the
                            remaining bars of the current chorus segment to play to completion. On the other hand, if a
                            16+ hit combo is indeed attained, the second 4 bars of the chorus will play. Additionally,
                            if either fighter’s health drops low enough during the Combo state, the system chooses to
                            remain in the Combo state and the 4 bar chorus segments will continue to play back-to-back.
                        </p>

                        <p>The ingenuity of the system is that the most intense parts of the soundtrack, which is
                            typically the chorus, always play during the most intense moments of the match while the
                            verse of the soundtrack, typically not as intense, plays during all other moments of the
                            match.</p>

                        <h4>Breaker</h4>

                        <p>And the announcer goes...</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="https://heraldofgargos.github.io/journal/assets/killer_instinct_3.jpg">
                            <figcaption>C-C-COMBO BREAKER!</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>The music enters the Breaker state during a combo breaker, a signature game mechanic in the
                            Killer Instinct franchise. It is attained when a fighter is able to break free by
                            interrupting the opponent’s combo with the right button combination. Killer Instinct’s music
                            system acknowledges a combo
                            breaker by interrupting the current music segment with a one-off musical breaker sequence.
                            Afterwards, a new music segment is restarted from the beginning, depending on the current
                            music state. It reflects the sense of a combo being interrupted and having to start over
                            from the beginning.</p>

                        <h4>Boring</h4>
                        <p>This state kicks in if both players remain still with no controller inputs given. After a
                            while, the music system transitions to the Boring state, playing a calmer low
                            intense version of the soundtrack. In some cases, the system will play remixed versions of
                            the same song from the original 1994 Killer Instinct. This state is somewhat of an easter
                            egg in the
                            game.</p>

                        <h4>Danger</h4>
                        <p>Each track in the lineup also has an accompanying “danger” theme that plays when the health
                            of either
                            fighter drops below a certain threshold, in similar vein to the classic KI games. The danger
                            theme creates a sense of urgency as it foreshadows the impending defeat of a fighter.</p>

                        <h4>Ending</h4>
                        <p>An ending segment will play if the match ends without either player instigating an Ultra
                            Combo (more on this later). Each track in Killer Instinct’s lineup also has multiple
                            variants of the ending segment, and a random ending is cued every time to avoid monotony.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Musical Ultras</h2>
                        <p>In Killer Instinct, an Ultra Combo can be used to finish off your opponent with style. It can
                            only be activated while your opponent is in the Danger state. The 2013 reboot makes
                            this even more stylish with the introduction of musical ultras, allowing the music to
                            synchronise with the punches and kicks of the ultra combo. It is one of the most unique and
                            iconic aspects of Killer Instinct’s sound design.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <video controls="" preload="">
                                <source src="assets/killer_instinct_4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                            </video>
                            <figcaption>What a musical ultra looks (and sounds) like</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>A musical ultra can be deconstructed as follows. Each theme in Killer Instinct has several
                            ultra combo “hit” sounds associated with that theme. From the 2014 GDC presentation for
                            Killer Instinct, I confirmed that there are 50 such hits. Each hit progressively rises in
                            frequency, effectively forming a musical scale. Each fighter is then assigned a sequence of
                            notes from this scale that the game engine cues for every punch and kick during the ultra
                            combo. Because every theme in the soundtrack has its own bank of ultra combo hits, it sounds
                            cohesive when played alongside that theme. And because the sequence of hits chosen from the
                            bank is consistent for each fighter, the melody itself remains consistent
                            across themes.</p>

                        <h2>Instinct Meter</h2>
                        <p>Yet another neat but subtle music feature is how Killer Instinct makes use of vertical
                            remixing to introduce a musical flourish into the mix as the fighter’s instinct meter (the
                            yellow bar in the screenshots) fills up. There are two distinct layers for this, per each
                            fighter. The layers themselves are also panned left or right depending on the current
                            position of the respective fighter.</p>

                        <h2>Wrapping things up</h2>

                        <p>The soundtrack of Killer Instinct, composed by Mick Gordon, was spectacular. It modernised
                            the original themes composed by Robin Beanland while remaining faithful to the KI identity.
                            Celldweller and Atlas Plug complimented the lineup by composing additional tracks for Killer
                            Instinct Season 3 while Mick went onto compose the score for the highly acclaimed DOOM
                            (2016). Jean-Edouard Miclot was the audio director for KI and ensured that Mick had complete
                            ownership of the music, including both composition and implementation. I also have strong
                            reason to believe that Killer Instinct inspired
                            the music implementation for Devil May Cry 5, as its music system follows a similar
                            framework. Casey Edwards and Ali Edwards, who worked with Mick on KI, are also the artists
                            behind DMC 5’s most beloved “Devil Trigger” theme.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, Killer Instinct’s sound design team went above and beyond to deliver one of
                            the best sounding games of the eighth generation console lineup, and should continue to be
                            commemorated for years to come. FIGHT ON!</p>

      <description>The story behind why I got into motorcycling, my personal experience with it, and some pro tips for beginner riders</description>
      <content:encoded>
            <![CDATA[<h2>“Ride like everybody is out to kill you”</h2>
                        <p>— is a phrase every rider has heard
                            sooner or later in their motorcycling journey. In the state of Victoria in Australia,
                            motorcycles make up 4% of all registered vehicles, yet account for 17% of deaths and serious
                            injuries. Similar figures can also be seen in the UK and a vast majority of cases are due
                            to the negligence of other road users. The dangers associated with motorcycles are
                            well-documented, widely acknowledged
                            and backed up by statistics. With all that said, how did I possibly end up here?</p>

                        <p>To the surprise of friends and close associates, I bought a motorcycle early last year,
                            incentivised by my declining mental health at the time. Many motorcyclists find
                            that riding significantly contributes to stress reduction and improves their mental
                            well-being. The demands of motorcycling necessitate constant alertness and the rider’s
                            complete mental focus. It is, in its own unique way, a form of mindfulness meditation. After
                            nearly a year of motorcycling, do I agree with these claims? To a great extent, I do.
                            There’s also neuroscience research to back up these claims conducted by researchers at UCLA.
                            They found that riding a motorcycle for 20 minutes resulted in decreased cortisol levels,
                            greater tolerance to distractions, and enhanced sensory focus in participants.</p>
                        <p>On my motorcycling journey, I discovered that there are many other benefits to riding other
                            than its therapeutic effects. A vast majority of these benefits are often understated
                            and overshadowed by the prevailing negative connotations associated with motorcycling.</p>

                        <h2>It’s not all doom and gloom</h2>
                        <p>Riding a motorcycle creates a deep sense of unity between you and your surroundings. You feel
                            the
                            wind’s exhilarating rush, a sense of freedom. You feel the temperatures shift ever so
                            slightly as you move from shade to sun. You’re fully enveloped in the sights, sounds and
                            smells of your surroundings. All these elements come together to create the perfect
                            adventure for
                            travellers wanting to immerse themselves in their environment. If travelling solo isn’t your
                            thing, you can always bring along a passenger to share the experience with. A motorcycle is
                            an
                            excellent choice for travel enthusiasts and adventure seekers.</p>

                        <p>A motorcycle can make commuting to work fun. When rush hour hits, roads transform into
                            car parks and the crawl begins. On a motorcycle you won’t have to
                            spend too long in
                            asphalt purgatory. Here in Australia, motorcyclists can filter through stopped and slow
                            moving traffic and it's completely legal if done safely. It’s also legal in the UK and most
                            states of the USA. However, you may not exceed 30 km/h while doing so, as that is considered
                            “lane-splitting” and is unlawful. Coming up with the most efficient strategy to get through
                            traffic is a fun little exercise to play on your commute, as long as you do it safely and
                            responsibly.</p>
                        <p>On a motorcycle, other road users will be more open to striking a conversation with you while
                            stopped at the lights or in traffic. Me being an introvert, I usually do not initiate these
                            conversations but there have been numerous instances where someone would put down their car
                            window to compliment my bike, or a kid at the backseat would start waving. You will also get
                            lots of nods from other motorcyclists and it’s always a great moment when that happens.</p>
                        <p>Riding a motorcycle also gives you unbeatable fuel efficiency and your commute contributes
                            less emissions to the environment compared to the average car driver. A motorcycle may be a
                            poor choice for hauling goods and people but for a white-collar office worker like myself,
                            it makes for an excellent commuting machine.</p>
                        <p>Oh, and as an added bonus, riding a motorcycle burns a lot more calories than you might
                            think. According to Dr. Michael, a radiologist who rides motorcycles, you can expect to burn
                            up to 300 calories per every hour of riding. Although the actual number varies quite a bit
                            based on the intensity of riding. For example, off-roaders and enduro riders will burn more
                            calories than the average city commuter. Nevertheless, it’s a nice added perk for those
                            wanting to stay fit.</p>

                        <h2>Paying it forward</h2>
                        <p>Being entirely self-taught, my motorcycling knowledge is largely derived from my own personal
                            experience but also from the insights shared by fellow riders. Now
                            I’m paying it forward by sharing my own experiences and some pro tips. I hope this may be
                            beneficial to
                            someone who’s new to riding or is interested in getting into it.</p>

                        <h3>Like taming a horse</h3>
                        <p>Learn and understand how your motorcycle behaves. Emphasis on “your” as
                            every motorcycle is tuned differently and handles differently. The throttle response, the
                            turning radius, the suspension rebound, and the biting point of the clutch are all
                            different from model to model. Which is why it’s extremely important that you learn and
                            understand the characteristics of your own motorcycle. The phrase “become one with the bike”
                            gets thrown around a lot in motorcycling circles and for good reason. Even an experienced
                            motorcyclist with many years of riding experience can be considered a beginner on a bike
                            that
                            they have never ridden before. Take your motorcycle to a quiet place like an empty car park
                            where you can safely experiment with its controls and learn how it responds.</p>

                        <h3>“Pick a bike that doesn’t freak you out” - Keanu Reeves</h3>
                        <p>Obviously, before you do any of that, you need to pick a bike. You should
                            take Keanu’s advice here (he’s always right, anyway).</p>
                        <p>Stick to a sub-400cc motorcycle if you’ve never ridden before. Anything higher than this will
                            most likely overwhelm you. Here in Australia, there is also a CC limit imposed on
                            motorcycles that are considered “learner approved” and as of writing, the most powerful
                            learner approved motorcycle is the Yamaha MT-07 LAMS edition with an engine capacity of
                            655cc.</p>
                        <p>Aside from power, you should choose a bike with a seating position that you feel comfortable
                            with. Sport bikes like the Kawasaki Ninja 400 typically require the rider to assume a
                            forward-leaning position while naked bikes like the KTM 390 Duke or Kawasaki Z400 offer a
                            more upright seating position. For everyday riding, I consider the upright seating
                            position of a naked bike far more comfortable than the forward-leaning position of a sport
                            bike. But your experience may differ. Have a play around with several different motorcycles
                            at local dealerships and see which feels the most comfortable.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Don’t skimp out on gear</h3>
                        <p>Get yourself a decent helmet from a reputable brand. I strongly advise a full face helmet
                            with a Pinlock anti-fog insert. Beginner riders often neglect to buy protective equipment
                            when they start out. Acknowledge that as a beginner, you are at your most vulnerable. So
                            don’t skimp out on gear. Get yourself an abrasion resistant riding jacket, pants and boots.
                            If the typical “rider look” isn’t your style, there are plenty of riding gear that
                            masquerade as casual everyday clothes. But on the inside, they come with a lot of neat
                            safety features like weather proofing, kevlar lining, knee guards and elbow guards. With
                            options like these, you can express yourself while riding safely. Remember that the colour
                            of the gear you wear matters. White or brightly coloured gear helps you stand out and be
                            easily seen by other road users.</p>

                        <h3>True skill is in riding slow, not fast</h3>
                        <p>As it turns out, riding a motorcycle on a straight road at 100 km/h requires almost no
                            effort. Anybody could do that. On a motorcycle equipped with cruise control, this could be
                            done with your hands completely off the handlebars. Taking corners at 100 km/h is a
                            different story though. As a motorcyclist, your mastery of slow speed manoeuvres is a strong
                            indicator of your overall ability. Slow speed manoeuvres involve riding your motorcycle at
                            walking speed (under 5 km/h) with both feet up and making tight U-turns, among other things.
                            Pulling these off requires proper balance, good peripheral vision, and solid clutch control.
                            Here in Australia, all riders must complete an advanced motorcycle training course and the
                            accompanying practical test before they are allowed their full motorcycle license. And most
                            advanced motorcycle courses spend an exorbitant amount of time teaching these concepts and
                            making you practice them out on the range.</p>
                        <p>As a rider, I advise that you take matters into your own hands and spend some time practicing
                            these manoeuvres at your local car park. It could be just a quick 20 minute session after
                            you get back from work or uni. It will make you a safer rider as well as help you get
                            through the advanced motorcycle test with ease.</p>
                        <p>Your choice of motorcycle matters when it comes to slow speed manoeuvres. If you choose to
                            get a sport bike such as the Kawasaki Ninja 400, you will be at a disadvantage as the form
                            factor and seating position make pulling off slow manoeuvres more difficult.
                            Once again, I recommend picking a naked bike because they are much better suited for slow
                            speed manoeuvres than sport bikes or cruisers. That’s in addition to their comfortable
                            upright seating position which also makes them more suitable for everyday riding. The
                            Kawasaki Z400, the Yamaha MT–03 and KTM’s 390 Duke are excellent beginner naked bikes. When
                            taking the advanced motorcycle test in Australia, you can choose to bring your
                            own motorcycle to do the test with. All three motorcycles I’ve listed previously are
                            great choices for the test. Obviously, your ability as a rider matters greatly here, it’s
                            not just about the type of motorcycle you ride.</p>

                        <h3>Zero BAC, at all times</h3>
                        <p>Aim for zero blood alcohol content if you need to ride your motorcycle. Riding a motorcycle
                            requires far
                            more finesse and skill than driving a car. Your sense of balance is critical while riding.
                            Even a little bit of alcohol in your system can impair your senses and put you off balance.
                            Don’t drink and ride, it’s not worth it.</p>

                        <h3>Lane filter responsibly</h3>
                        <p>Lane filtering with a motorcycle is both scary and rewarding at the same time. Only lane
                            filter if you feel like it’s safe to do so and stay within a reasonable speed. In Australia,
                            filtering at over 30 km/h is illegal and will get you pulled over. As a rule of thumb, I
                            also avoid filtering next to large vehicles such as lorries and buses. If you are filtering
                            up to the lights, I advise staying behind the first row of vehicles instead of filtering
                            straight up to the front. The first row of vehicles will start moving as soon as the lights
                            go green and if you happen to be in the middle of this row when that happens, it will put
                            you in a dangerous situation. Note that drivers stuck in traffic are often distracted, so
                            always pay close attention to other vehicles while filtering. Turning on your motorcycle’s
                            hazard lights is a good way to draw attention to yourself and also signal to other road
                            users that you are filtering. Make sure to turn them off afterwards. You will only get good
                            at lane filtering the more you do it, but please do it responsibly and safely.</p>

                        <h3>Minimise risks, maximise rewards</h3>
                        <p>I’ll wrap things up by stating that while motorcycling has its risks, those risks can be
                            mitigated by proper training, wearing safety gear, maintaining good awareness, and by
                            following the rules. I would argue that a cyclist riding a push bicycle would be at a
                            greater risk than a skilled motorcyclist who sticks to the above principles. Most push
                            cyclists do not wear any protective gear, are completely exposed and do not have the
                            capability to quickly get out of sticky situations, should one arise.
                            Both cyclists and motorcyclists should take extra care at all times.</p>

                        <p>Motorcycles can be a great stress reliever, a highly efficient commuting machine and also
                            perfect for travel enthusiasts wanting to immerse themselves in their surroundings. You just
                            don’t get the same experience inside an air conditioned metal cage. I cannot understate the
                            risks however. But I also think the benefits can outweigh the risks, if those risks are
                            properly managed.</p>

                        <p>Thanks for making it to the end and I hope it was enlightening. I wish you all the best in
                            your own motorcycling journey.</p>
