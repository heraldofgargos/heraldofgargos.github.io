                        <h2>Preface</h2>
                        <p>In this technical piece, I break down the interactive music system in the 2013 Killer
                            Instinct Reboot for Xbox One. It’s somewhat of an old article as the research I’ve done here
                            came
                            out of a student game I worked on at university. The details are still very much relevant
                            and I’ve refreshed minor tid-bits while keeping the bulk of it intact.</p>

                        <figure>

                        <p>Right off the bat, I’ll state that Killer Instinct has the best soundtrack ever
                            composed for a fighting game, and that’s saying a lot given the existence of both Guilty
                            Gear and Street Fighter. I’ll also go on to state that it’s one of the greatest OSTs of the
                            eighth gen console lineup and one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever composed. The
                            gushing doesn’t stop there. It also has one of the best implemented
                            interactive music systems in any video game.</p>

                        <p>An interactive music system alters the music in response to player actions and changing
                            conditions in the game. Some notable examples include SSX (2012) which applies a parametric
                            EQ filter to the soundtrack when performing tricks, or Transistor (2014) which vertically
                            remixes the instrumental version of the soundtrack with a vocal-only version depending on
                            the game
                            state.</p>

                        <h2>Music states</h2>
                        <p>Killer Instinct’s music system consists of several different states and each state
                            corresponds to a particular condition in the game itself. The music states are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fighter A Intro</li>
                            <li>Fighter B Intro</li>
                            <li>Intro</li>
                            <li>Normal</li>
                            <li>Combo</li>
                            <li>Breaker</li>
                            <li>Boring</li>
                            <li>Danger</li>
                            <li>Ending</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The music system uses horizontal
                            resequencing to transition between the states based on the
                            current condition of the match. Killer Instinct utilises Audiokinetic Wwise to implement
                            this.</p>

                        <h3>Breakdown</h3>

                        <p>Now I’ll attempt to break down each of these states and explain which game conditions are
                            required as a prerequisite to activate them. I made extensive use of Killer Instinct’s fight
                            replay feature which allows stopping time and frame stepping. This has so many use cases and
                            one of them is examining how the music system works.</p>

                        <h4>Fighter A Intro</h4>
                        <p>Killer Instinct is a one-versus-one fighting game. At the start of every match, a short
                            cutscene ensues introducing each fighter. The music system includes two consecutive
                            states to underscore each fighter’s introductory segment. The system initially starts
                            things off in this state. After the first fighter’s introduction is delivered, the music
                            transitions into the next state.</p>

                        <h4>Fighter B Intro</h4>
                        <p>When the second fighter’s introductory cutscene plays, the music system follows up with the
                            introduction of additional layers in the mix.</p>

                        <h4>Intro</h4>
                        <p>After both fighters are introduced, control is handed over to the players and the match
                            formally begins. A short musical intro will ensue and the music transitions into the Normal
                            state.</p>

                        <h4>Normal</h4>
                        <p>As with most other pieces of music, the songs in Killer Instinct consist of
                            distinct sections such as verse, chorus, breakdown and ending. In the Normal state, the
                            music system only cues music segments from the verse of the current song. The game, on
                            average, spends most of its time in this state during a match. To keep things interesting,
                            Killer Instinct divides each verse into 4 bar segments and the sequence of the segments are
                            randomised, generating a different permutation of the verse on each instance of playback.
                            Wwise’s random containers are used to implement this.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets/killer_instinct_1.jpg" />
                            <figcaption>A 16 hit combo against Cinder</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <h4>Combo</h4>

                        <p>The system transitions to the Combo state if either fighter achieves a 16 hit combo or higher
                            during the match. In the combo state, the system only cues segments from the chorus of the
                            song, which are also divided into 4 bar segments. No randomisation between the segments is
                            performed in the Combo state. If either player is unable to attain a follow-up 16 hit combo
                            during this period, the system transitions back to the Normal state, but allows the
                            remaining bars of the current chorus segment to play to completion. On the other hand, if a
                            16+ hit combo is indeed attained, the second 4 bars of the chorus will play. Additionally,
                            if either fighter’s health drops low enough during the Combo state, the system chooses to
                            remain in the Combo state and the 4 bar chorus segments will continue to play back-to-back.
                        </p>

                        <p>The ingenuity of the system is that the most intense parts of the soundtrack, which is
                            typically the chorus, always play during the most intense moments of the match while the
                            verse of the soundtrack, typically not as intense, plays during all other moments of the
                            match.</p>

                        <h4>Breaker</h4>

                        <p>And the announcer goes...</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="assets/killer_instinct_3.jpg" />
                            <figcaption>C-C-COMBO BREAKER!</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>The music enters the Breaker state during a combo breaker, a signature game mechanic in the
                            Killer Instinct franchise. It is attained when a fighter is able to break free by
                            interrupting the opponent’s combo with the right button combination. Killer Instinct’s music
                            system acknowledges a combo
                            breaker by interrupting the current music segment with a one-off musical breaker sequence.
                            Afterwards, a new music segment is restarted from the beginning, depending on the current
                            music state. It reflects the sense of a combo being interrupted and having to start over
                            from the beginning.</p>

                        <h4>Boring</h4>
                        <p>This state kicks in if both players remain still with no controller inputs given. After a
                            while, the music system transitions to the Boring state, playing a calmer low
                            intense version of the soundtrack. In some cases, the system will play remixed versions of
                            the same song from the original 1994 Killer Instinct. This state is somewhat of an easter
                            egg in the
                            game.</p>

                        <h4>Danger</h4>
                        <p>Each track in the lineup also has an accompanying “danger” theme that plays when the health
                            of either
                            fighter drops below a certain threshold, in similar vein to the classic KI games. The danger
                            theme creates a sense of urgency as it foreshadows the impending defeat of a fighter.</p>

                        <h4>Ending</h4>
                        <p>An ending segment will play if the match ends without either player instigating an Ultra
                            Combo (more on this later). Each track in Killer Instinct’s lineup also has multiple
                            variants of the ending segment, and a random ending is cued every time to avoid monotony.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Musical Ultras</h2>
                        <p>In Killer Instinct, an Ultra Combo can be used to finish off your opponent with style. It can
                            only be activated while your opponent is in the Danger state. The 2013 reboot makes
                            this even more stylish with the introduction of musical ultras, allowing the music to
                            synchronise with the punches and kicks of the ultra combo. It is one of the most unique and
                            iconic aspects of Killer Instinct’s sound design.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <video controls preload>
                                <source src="assets/killer_instinct_4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                            </video>
                            <figcaption>What a musical ultra looks (and sounds) like</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>A musical ultra can be deconstructed as follows. Each theme in Killer Instinct has several
                            ultra combo “hit” sounds associated with that theme. From the 2014 GDC presentation for
                            Killer Instinct, I confirmed that there are 50 such hits. Each hit progressively rises in
                            frequency, effectively forming a musical scale. Each fighter is then assigned a sequence of
                            notes from this scale that the game engine cues for every punch and kick during the ultra
                            combo. Because every theme in the soundtrack has its own bank of ultra combo hits, it sounds
                            cohesive when played alongside that theme. And because the sequence of hits chosen from the
                            bank is consistent for each fighter, the melody itself remains consistent
                            across themes.</p>

                        <h2>Instinct Meter</h2>
                        <p>Yet another neat but subtle music feature is how Killer Instinct makes use of vertical
                            remixing to introduce a musical flourish into the mix as the fighter’s instinct meter (the
                            yellow bar in the screenshots) fills up. There are two distinct layers for this, per each
                            fighter. The layers themselves are also panned left or right depending on the current
                            position of the respective fighter.</p>

                        <h2>Wrapping things up</h2>

                        <p>The soundtrack of Killer Instinct, composed by Mick Gordon, was spectacular. It modernised
                            the original themes composed by Robin Beanland while remaining faithful to the KI identity.
                            Celldweller and Atlas Plug complimented the lineup by composing additional tracks for Killer
                            Instinct Season 3 while Mick went onto compose the score for the highly acclaimed DOOM
                            (2016). Jean-Edouard Miclot was the audio director for KI and ensured that Mick had complete
                            ownership of the music, including both composition and implementation. I also have strong
                            reason to believe that Killer Instinct inspired
                            the music implementation for Devil May Cry 5, as its music system follows a similar
                            framework. Casey Edwards and Ali Edwards, who worked with Mick on KI, are also the artists
                            behind DMC 5’s most beloved “Devil Trigger” theme.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, Killer Instinct’s sound design team went above and beyond to deliver one of
                            the best sounding games of the eighth generation console lineup, and should continue to be
                            commemorated for years to come. FIGHT ON!</p>
