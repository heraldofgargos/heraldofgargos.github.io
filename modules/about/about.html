<h2>Hi I’m Alex 👋</h2>
<p id="timezone-aware-p">I write computer software — for fun and for a living. I’m from Melbourne, Australia but
    currently based in
    Adelaide</p>
<p>On my website, you can find all sorts of random stuff. It’s basically my little corner on the interwebs.
    Follow my journal for commentary on a variety of topics. I write about anything that interests me. It isn’t just
    about programming or tech. Apologies if
    things get too philosophical though.</p>
<p>Some fun facts about me:</p>
<ul id="fun-facts">
    <li>I’m a Christmas Eve kid 🎄</li>
    <li>Yet my favourite season is autumn 🍂</li>
    <li>I like travelling and exploring new places 🏍️</li>
    <li>My favourite anime of all time is Steins Gate 🧑‍🔬</li>
    <li>I like tea — seriously, you can ask me anything about tea 🍃</li>
</ul>

        <p class="answer">✅ It’s written from scratch with pure HTML, JS and CSS.</p>
        <p>The trendy thing to do is use a single page application framework like the ones mentioned above and maybe
            also a
            CSS library. But writing from scratch makes things unique as every bit is handmade with a touch of
            the
            author’s flair. Pragmatically though, writing code from scratch makes implementing niche features so
            much
            easier
            because you won’t have to conform to the rules of the framework you are using. And I expect to be
            writing a
            lot
            of niche stuff on this website like music apps.</p>
        <p>Oh, and the entire build system for this site was handwritten too.</p>
