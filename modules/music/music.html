<h1>Adventures with music synthesisers</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    When I start talking about “Music Synthesisers”, most people’s minds go to keyboards. Sure, those are cool but a
    synthesiser is cooler and far more versatile. A keyboard generally consists of a basic synthesiser and in most cases
    only a sampler. A sampler consists of a set of pre-recorded sounds for each note that is then “sampled” as you hit
    the keys on the keyboard. A synthesizer generates these tones in real-time using sine wave manipulation. Remember
    that all sounds are made of sine waves? This means you can customise the parameters of a synthesizer to create
    basically any sound you want, effectively letting you create your own instruments. Most keyboards, except for a
    handful of high-end ones, only consist of a sampler and won’t let you create your own instruments so they are not
    the same as a synthesiser.

    Physical synthesisers really are the cream of the crop but they are expensive and generally bulky. Today, thanks to
    the advancement of digital audio, there are many digital synths like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://xferrecords.com/products/serum/">Serum</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://vital.audio/">Vital</a> which are
    equally awesome. In
    many cases these software synths are far more versatile and most importantly, more practical than physical synths,
    especially for hobbyists. I’ve been dabbling in software synths for many years now, initially starting out with
    basic Fruity Loops VSTs and currently using Serum and Vital with Ableton Live. When I got into university, I started
    writing my own little synthesiser plugins in C++ which was a lot of fun.

<h2>Interactive Audio Apps</h2>
<p>Lately I’ve been playing around with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API">Web
        Audio API</a>. It’s a relatively new API that makes audio programming more
    accessible not just for software engineers but also users. All you need is an up to date web browser and you’re good
    to go. My plan for this section is to publish interactive audio apps built with the Web Audio API. So
    you can come here and start fiddling with them right here in the web browser. There will also be an accompanying
    entry in the <a href="#journal">journal</a> outlining my development philosophy and design decisions so keep an eye
    out for that too.</p>
